# Star Wars Planet Quiz Game

This is a simple project to explore a lot of the features from **Angular**, **Angular FlexLayout**, and **HTML/CSS**. Furthermore, the app was developed with reactive programming using **NGRX**, **RxJS** and **Observables**.

I did not use any front-end framework, such as **Angular Material**, **Ionic**, **Bootstrap** and so on. I decided to use just the good and old **CSS** to create all the style of the application. Thereby, I can show my knowledge of how to create UIs without any framework.

I also used **@media screen** to make the UI responsible and to have some differences in Mobile screens.
